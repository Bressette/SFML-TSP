C++ program using SFML for basic graphics that outputs the numerical value of the shortest hamiltonian circuit
for a given k5 complete graph. The algorithm is a solution to the traveling salesman problem using dynamic programming that runs in ![equation](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=O%282%5E%7Bn%7D%2An%5E%7B2%7D%29%20&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=0).
The weight of each edge is randomly generated and pressing any key with the program open will generate new edge weights
and calculate the new lowest cost hamiltonian circuit.
