C++ program using SFML for basic graphics that outputs the numerical value of the shortest hamiltonian circuit
for a given k5 complete graph. The display of the complete graph nodes uses hard coded positions 
and the algorithm is a solution to the traveling salesman problem using dynamic programming that runs in O(2^n*n^2).
The weight of each edge is randomly generated and pressing any key with the program open will generate new edge weights
and calculate the new lowest cost hamiltonian circuit.
